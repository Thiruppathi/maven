## Maven Build Process

Maven simplifies the process of packaging the code.

### Build Life Cycle

Build lifecycle consisists of different phases. Some fo the phases have default beahviours. Specify the build phase you need. Previous phase automatically runs.

####Commonly Used Phases

* validate - Validation checks on the projects.
* compile - Compiles the JAVA Code.
* test - Executes the test cases available in test folder.
* package - Creates jar/war/ear files based on the configuration.
* install - Installs the generated package into local repository(.m2 folder)
* deploy - Deploys the project to repository for other users to use. It doesn't deploy to App Server.

Compile Phase

```
mvn compile
```

Generates ```.class``` files inside ```target``` folder.


```
mvn test
```

Executes the Test Cases available in the ```test``` folder. Initial setup has dummy testcases generated by maven.


```
mvn package
```

Generates ```jar/war/ear``` based on the ```pom.xml``` configuration.

```
mvn install
```

Downloads the dependencies from the central repository & installs your project to the local repository.
